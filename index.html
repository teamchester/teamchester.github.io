              <h2>About the Simulation</h2>
              <h3>Capsim as our team understands it.</h3>
              <p>There was definitely a learning curve to the simulation, and we are finally starting to get the hang of things. It was very useful to spend the first few weeks in a practice round to make sure we understood all of the functions of Cpasim and how to read the weekly courier. At this point in the semester, we are all very familiar with the courier and what information is important to us when it comes to decision making.</p>
              <p>We quickly realized the difference between short term and long term decisions. During our practice rounds, we were very successful because we were able to simply focus on quick and easy results, without worrying too much about what the long term consequences would be. We didnâ€™t have to plan for rounds when purchasing activity would be down in general, and our competitors were not as experienced either, so it was a playing field of lower caliber.</p>
              <p>Along with the basic features of Capsim, we have learned how to accurately forecast in order to have the most efficient production. However, accurate forecasting and correct production alone cannot make up for poor decisions. After the end of last, we saw that we still had a lot of inventory remaining despite producing a reasonable amount. After analyzing the courier, we realized that there were multiple reasons as to why we were unable to move our product: 1) Our price was too high. Although we priced our products within the preferred range of our customers, we did not take into account the prices of our competitors, which allowed them to undercut us. 2) We did not invest enough in performance and marketing. The main takeaway from our poor performance last week was that we need to take all factors into account before making a decision.</p>

          <h3>Strategy and Performance</h3>
          <p>What it looks like to actually implement a broad cost leader strategy.</p>
        </header>

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <div class="why-us-content">
              <p>Right from round 1, and based on what we tried and learned from the practice rounds, we chose to maintain a strategy that surrounds the idea of being a broad cost leader. Rather than focusing on a niche market segment and/or trying to be at the forefront of research and development to try to differentiate our products from other competitors, we instead defined success to mean that we have a relatively high market share in all market segments, appealing to customers regardless of what they may be looking for (extremely cheap products, high-performance products, low-size products, etc).</p>
              <p>Thus far, we have had a mix of effective and ineffective decisions to support this strategy. We consistently maintain a conservative approach to our R&D investments, understanding that the side effect of being a cost leader is that you simply cannot afford to be ahead of the curve all the time. Where there is a bit of a struggle is when it comes to our pricing. We do try to be cost leaders in the market, but it is challenging at times to determine what range of pricing our competitors will go for, and as a result we have sometimes priced our products more than we should have, in retrospect.</p>
              <p>Looking over our price history, one would notice the steady downward trend of prices, as we try to consistently but steadily compete with other companies. Our promotion and sales budgets have also been steadily decreased, although this trend may change for the next few rounds.</p>

                <h4>Stock price</h4>
                <p>Our stock price had declined slightly from the previous increase after round 4, although it is still significantly higher than the other companies.</p>

              <div class="features wow bounceInUp clearfix">

                <h4>Returns</h4>
                <p>Our ROS for the most recent round ended up decreasing from 9.4% in round 4 to 0%; our ROE was also 0% by the end of the most recent round, down from 16.9% in round 4.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="features wow bounceInUp clearfix">
                <i class="fa fa-language" style="color: #589af1;"></i>
                <h4>Overall performance</h4>
                <p>Our P/E ratio for this round was -5816.3 which indicates negative profit or that the company is losing money. We unfortunately lost $23,103 in the most recent round, although we did not end up taking an emergency loan (which we did in one round earlier). The reason for lack of sales this round (as opposed to $155.5m in sales last round) has most likely to do with our prices; they were pretty high compared to our competitors, and on top of that we are significantly behind in performance within our market segments. Because we did choose the broad cost leader strategy we need to be more wary of our prices compared to the other competitors to make sure we set them more efficiently next round.</p>

            <p>
              After analyzing the past five rounds we realized that we havenâ€™t been fulfilling our broad cost leader strategy to its full extent. Our main goal these next rounds will be to try and lead each market using low prices as the main factor.

            <h4>Assessing the competition</h4>
            <p>
              Although we started off in a good spot, we now see that going forward we will have to cut our prices in larger percentages as our competitors have cut our prices in the past couple rounds. Therefore, our first step in the next round will be to better predict competitors price cuts so that we can once again be the cost leaders of all the product segments. We believe that reducing the price and better tuning our performance and size will make us the leaders in all the segments within the next round. Following that we will also be investing in ways to create demand for our product within TQM as well as reduce researching and development cost/time so that we may get newer products out faster to beat our competitors to meet the market's needs. If we invest in lowering cost/time now we'll see it pay off throughout the next four rounds. The more we are able to cut our cost the more we are able to reduce product price. Lastly the area we need to focus on to capture more demand would be market and sales. As weâ€™ve made some missteps, we need to make sure that the markets are fully aware of our products and have easy access to buy the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              We plan to continue using long term debt and selling stock as the main forms to finance these investments. We learned from past mistakes that a mix of both is best as we wouldnâ€™t want our stock price to fall or interest percent to rise. Given that we also have a lot of leftover product from the previous round we wouldnâ€™t have to spend as much on production next couple rounds and more invest in the areas previously discussed.

                Right off the bat, we made sure to establish and maintain psychological safety. Each group member is expected to respect the views and opinions of others. While it's okay to disagree, it's important to remember we're all on the same team.

                We had a tough time deciding if we should be broad, or focus on a niche market. Should we be cost leaders and undercut the market, or should we aim to be differentiators and not worry too much about competitive pricing? Ultimately, based on our previous experiences (namely the Capsim practice rounds), we decided that a broad cost leader strategy was something we were all interested in pursuing, and thought would be feasible given our overall comfort level with risk.

                Instead of assigning individual parts to each group member, which could lead to a lack of overall group input, and make it easy to play the blame game when it came poor decision-making, we decided that we should each pull up a different type of report/file and work together on the same decision segment.

              <p>
                In order to bring up our motivation at points where it may have started to drop down a bit, we reminded ourselves that even though the market and industry overall are not in our control, we ultimately have complete control over our own decisions, and this made our decision-making process feel much more important to each of us.
